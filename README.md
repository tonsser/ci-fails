# Circleci failures

This is a small CLI that finds the test files that failed for a given circleci build.

It is currently very specific to the Tonsser API, so wont work for other projects at the moment.

## Setup

1. Install Rust.
2. Install this with `cargo install --force --git https://github.com/tonsser/ci-fails.git`.

You also run `cargo install --force --git https://github.com/tonsser/ci-fails.git` to update to the latest version.

## Usage

Run `ci-fails --help` for more info.
